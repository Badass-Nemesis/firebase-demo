# üìí Firebase Backend API

## Overview
This project is a Node.js backend API, developed using TypeScript and Firebase. It handles user authentication, profile management, and note storage with Firestore. Originally built for an internship assignment at Intellectworks, this API is designed to be easy to deploy and extend.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Node.js** with **TypeScript**
- **Firebase** (Firestore, Firebase Auth, Firebase Functions)
- **Express.js** for handling HTTP requests
- **Cors** for enabling cross-origin resource sharing
- **Helmet** for security enhancements

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure
### Collections:
1. **Users**
   - Documents representing individual users with fields:
     - `createdAt`: Timestamp of user creation (string)
     - `email`: User's email (string)
     - `name`: User's name (string)
     - `uid`: User's unique ID (string)

2. **Notes**
   - Documents representing user notes with fields:
     - `content`: The content of the note (string)
     - `timestamp`: Time the note was created (string)
     - `title`: Title of the note (string)
     - `uid`: User's unique ID (string)

## üöÄ Deployment
The API is ready to be deployed. However, to host this on Firebase, you need to upgrade your Firebase plan to the Pay-as-you-go plan. This ensures you can use Firebase Functions without any limitations.

## üè¢ About
This project was developed as part of an assignment for the Intellectworks backend internship. It showcases the use of Node.js, TypeScript, and Firebase to create a robust backend service with user authentication and note management functionalities.

Happy coding! üéâ


### I've uploaded my API key and credentials.json in this project but I'll delete it later after few days. üòä
